Question 1: 
Write a program that prompts the user to enter an investment amount and an annual percentage
interest rate, and prints a table that displays future value for the years from 1 to 30. 

Question 2: 
Write a method that checks whether a string is a valid password. Suppose the password rules are as follows:
 A password must have at least two character.
 A password consists of only letters and digits.
 A password must contain at least three digits.

Question 3: 
Write a program that reads in a string representing a series of results of a sports team, where ’W’
represents a win, ’D’ represents a draw, and ’L’ represents a loss. Assuming three points for a win,
one for a draw, and zero for a loss, your program should return the points total of the team over
the games, and their average points-per-game. Your program should check that the input string
only contains the characters ’W’, ’D’, or ’L’, ignoring case.
